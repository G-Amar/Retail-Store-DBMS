# Retail Store DBMS
This is a full Clothing Retail Store RDBMS created from the ground up on Oracle 11g/12c

This project is a group collaboration with me, Sudipto Bose, and Cedric Li-Chay-Chung

This project implements a RDBMS for a small-medium clothing retail store along with many SQL commands that will extract usefull information from the database and present it in a useful way.

Along with this, there is also a fully functional Unix shell program that will run commands to populate/delete tables on the server where the database is being hosted.

There is also a full web GUI written in PHP that connects to the Oracle database and allows the user to retrieve useful information from the database.
